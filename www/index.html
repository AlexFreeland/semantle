                Like <a href="https://www.wordleunlimited.com/">Wordle</a>, but better.
                The computer chooses a word, and you have to guess it.
            </p>
            <p>
                Each guess will be rated based on its semantic similarity to the target word.
                Similarity ranges from -1 (least) to 1 (most,) but be aware that the computer's
                conception of what exactly "semantic similarity" entails can be kind of, uhhhh,
                abstruse, so don't be too shocked if you and it aren't always on the same page.
                Like: a word's antonym isn't going to get a rating of -1, because there are still
                a whole bunch of ways in which the words <i>are</i> similar, for example: they're
                both in the same lexical category, and they both occupy a common conceptual space.
                Even this is anthropomorphizing it too much -- it's an algorithm, dude.  The abstractions
                which it uses to weigh its judgements are far queerer than we could possibly imagine.
                Anyway this is all way the christ beyond the scope of what we're doing here so just
                <a href="https://letmegooglethat.com/?q=word+embedding">Google "word embedding"</a>
                if you care.
            </p>
            <p>
                So, yes, right: the game.  You have unlimited guesses, and once you're within the two
                thousand closest words to the target you'll start earning <i>points</i>.  Correctly
                guessing the target word gets you <i>a thousand</i> of the fuckers.  Or you
                can give up at any point and advance to the next word with whatever score you've
                managed to accumulate so far.  There's no going back, though, so, you know...
                let's not be hasty, yeah?
            </p>
            <p>
                There's a new list of words to guess every day.  Good luck.
            </p>
